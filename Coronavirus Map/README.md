# Coronavirus Map

## Problem

All geographic visualisations currently avaliable only show the numbers per country which is not very helpful for making decisions about travel destinations within a country such as the UK. In order to make a more informed decision about travel destinations which in turns minimises the risk of infection of the traveller and hence the traveller's close contacts, a more detailed breakdown of the situation in each local district is required.

Current data are presented in the form of numbers - a visualisation of the density of cases is more representative than simply the number of cases.

Furthermore, some frontend is required to allow the visualisations to be easily accessible.
